*  Parsing and serializing large JSON objects can be computationally expensive.


* Software engineering is always a game of tradeoffs. Because something is in fashion doesnâ€™t make it universally right for all problems and use cases.
What matters is knowing about the different architectural options, understanding
their pros and cons, and, importantly, understanding the requirements and needs of
your own problem. (And, yes, in some cases and situations, having a monolith is OK.)


* The difference between 
(functions vs. serverless containers) is just the degree to which developers want to shift the
boundaries of shared responsibilities. Containers give you a bit more control over
user space libraries and network capabilities.
